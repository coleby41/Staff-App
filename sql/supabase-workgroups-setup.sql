-- Workgroups + nav access — powers the new "Workgroups" tab under IT Tools
-- (workgroups.html / workgroups.js) and the shared nav-access.js that every
-- page now loads.
--
-- Same conventions as the rest of this app: no Supabase Auth, so RLS is
-- permissive-to-anon with access control enforced client-side.
--
-- IMPORTANT: nav-access.js is written to "fail open" if these tables don't
-- exist yet — it does nothing and leaves every page's existing hardcoded
-- checks in charge, exactly like before. Nothing changes for anyone until
-- this file has been run. Once it has, nav-access.js takes over as the
-- authoritative source for who sees what.
--
-- The seed data below is deliberately built to match today's REAL behavior
-- exactly (see the notes inline), so running this migration doesn't
-- silently change anyone's access — it just makes the existing rules
-- editable from the Workgroups tab going forward.

-- create-account dropdown; "IT", "Office", "Accounting" are used throughout
-- the app's existing hardcoded checks; "Super Admin" is the bypass-all group
-- used in most of those same checks (note: it was never actually selectable
-- in the create-account dropdown before now — Coleby, worth deciding whether
-- "Owner" was meant to BE this group, since right now they're two separate,
-- unrelated names in the data); "Operations" is the fallback group name used
-- when creating a user without picking one.

-- Seed access to match today's real behavior:
--   - Dashboard, New Project Onboarding, Excel Workbook Templates, Form
--     Templates, Staff Finance, Vendor Contacts: every workgroup today
--     (no gating exists anywhere for these).
--   - Payroll Tools: Office + Accounting (Super Admin already bypasses).
--     Note: payroll-tools.html's OWN internal check was actually stricter
--     (Accounting + Super Admin only, Office was missing) — that looks like
--     a pre-existing inconsistency between pages, not something intentional.
--     This seed uses the more common Office+Accounting+Super Admin version.
--   - Manage Employees: nobody via workgroup — today it's purely "is this
--     person's role = Manager, or are they Super Admin", which nav-access.js
--     keeps doing in addition to whatever's configured here.
--   - Create account / Staff users / Workgroups (IT Tools): IT only
--     (Super Admin already bypasses).
