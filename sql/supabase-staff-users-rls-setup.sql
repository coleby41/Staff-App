-- staff_users — RLS + hiding password_hash from general reads.
--
-- IMPORTANT CONTEXT (read this before running):
-- This app does not use Supabase Auth. Sign-in queries staff_users directly
-- with the anon key and there's no auth.uid() to check — so RLS here can't
-- verify "this request is really from an IT admin", it can only restrict the
-- *shape* of what anon is allowed to do. Given that, this migration does two
-- things:
--   1. Baseline lockdown: turns RLS on (it likely wasn't before) with
--      policies that allow anon to do exactly what the app already does
--      today — insert new staff (admin-users.html), update staff (the
--      Staff Users admin page), but NOT select the raw table directly.
--   2. Hides password_hash from reads: instead of anon being able to
--      select(*) the whole table (which includes password_hash — that's how
--      login worked before), reads now go through either:
--        - a SECURITY DEFINER RPC (verify_staff_login) for the actual
--          sign-in check, which never returns password_hash, or
--        - a view (staff_users_directory) for everywhere else that reads
--          staff_users (the Staff Users admin page, Manage Employees'
--          direct-reports lookup, Payroll Tools' staff directory, and the
--          payroll PDF generator), which simply omits the password_hash
--          column.
--      Both are set up below. supabase-auth.js's login function, plus every
--      page/script that used to `.from('staff_users').select(...)`, were
--      updated to use these instead of reading the base table directly —
--      see staff-users.js, payroll-tools.js, manage-employees.js, and
--      payroll-pdf-stub.js.
--
-- Run this whole file once in the Supabase SQL editor. Nothing here changes
-- what the app does today from a user's perspective — same login flow, same
-- admin pages — it only closes off the raw table from being queried directly
-- with the anon key (e.g. via curl) for anything beyond insert/update.
-- ============================================================================

alter table public.staff_users enable row level security;

-- Anon can create new staff accounts (admin-users.html → createSupabaseUser)
-- and edit existing ones (staff-users.html's Staff Users admin page).
-- Note these aren't actually restricted to IT/Super Admin at the database
-- level — that check only happens in the app's JS today. Doing it for real
-- would require knowing who's asking, which this auth model can't do. If you
-- want that enforced server-side later, it needs a real identity on the
-- request (e.g. a Postgres function that takes a session token you issue at
-- login and validates it), not just RLS.

-- Deliberately no SELECT policy for anon on the base table — this is what
-- keeps password_hash from being readable via a plain
-- `.from('staff_users').select(...)` anymore. Reads happen through
-- verify_staff_login() (login) or staff_users_directory (admin listing)
-- below instead, both of which never expose password_hash.

-- Login, without exposing password_hash to the client.
--
-- Mirrors the exact match logic that used to run client-side in
-- supabase-auth.js: match against the SHA-256 hash the client already
-- computes, OR (legacy fallback that was already there) a stored value that
-- happens to just be the plaintext password. SECURITY DEFINER means this
-- runs with the function owner's privileges, so it can read password_hash
-- internally even though anon can't select it directly anymore.

-- ============================================================================
-- FOLLOW-UP FIX (added after staff-users.html updates went silently to 0
-- rows even though staff_users_update_anon above is fully permissive):
--
-- Postgres needs SELECT-level visibility on a row to identify it as a target
-- for UPDATE/DELETE — this is separate from, and in addition to, the
-- UPDATE policy's own using()/with check(). With RLS on and *no* SELECT
-- policy at all (which is what "deliberately no SELECT policy" above set
-- up), every row is invisible for this purpose, so any UPDATE's WHERE
-- clause matches nothing: no error, just 0 rows affected. That's the actual
-- cause of staff info not saving.
--
-- Fix: add the SELECT policy back so rows are visible, but keep
-- password_hash hidden via column-level grants instead of via RLS. anon can
-- only actually read the listed columns off the base table directly; a bare
-- `select=*` or a request for password_hash specifically will fail with a
-- column permission error. The admin directory continues reading through
-- staff_users_directory (unaffected, granted above) — this just gives RLS
-- something non-sensitive to check for write targeting.
